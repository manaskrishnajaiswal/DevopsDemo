# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

# Below code causes pipeline to run itself, when there is any change in branch e.g. master
trigger:
- master

# Below code uses ubuntu latest image as agent machine.
pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest
